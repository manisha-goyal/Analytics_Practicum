# Library Training Effectiveness Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a visual and statistical analysis of survey data aimed at evaluating the impact of library training on students' research skills. The study involves pre- and post-training surveys to measure the confidence levels of students in specific research-related tasks.

## Key Findings
- The analysis revealed a positive shift in student confidence across various research skills post-training.
- Specific improvements were noted in creating reference lists and searching online databases.
- Some areas, such as topic searching, did not show significant confidence gains, suggesting potential areas for training enhancement.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preparation were performed to ensure quality analysis.
- Exploratory visualizations and confirmatory statistical tests (Chi-Squared and T-Tests) were conducted to understand the training's effect.

## Technologies Used
- Tableau for data visualization.
- JMP for statistical analysis.
- Excel for data cleaning and preparation.
